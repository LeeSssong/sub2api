## Current fork integration — 2026-10-10

- Repository: `https://github.com/ranxi2001/sub2api`
- Branch: `production`
- Source commit: `ff9198947a70a83c59b8448f5ef13909119cfe7c`
- Version: `2.10.4`
- Previous imported source: `11be589504b482d77827ab383b4b53f777241238` (2.10.1)
- Method: 510 changed files imported from verified Git snapshots with three-way content merges; external history remains outside project main. Local billing/quota/admission, singleton roles, monitor-v4/SLA and user shell retained; Ent and Wire regenerated. Existing migration SQL bytes preserved.
- This release uses the user-authorized exact online migration pair `10a94ee6…` → `e5d79ffa…`; four new migrations have bounded lock/statement timeouts. Backward application recovery keeps schema/data and blocks incompatible active TOTP/Excel work, restart renewal orders and new provider platforms.
